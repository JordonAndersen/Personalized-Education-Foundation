        <p>At the Personalized Education Foundation, we are on a mission to transform lives through education. Our goal
            is to empower students and families by providing access to a personalized education experience. We achieve
            this through fundraising, Tuition Assistance, and the creation of an endowment for current and prospective members
            of the Christa McAuliffe Academy School of Arts and Sciences (CMASAS) community. With your support, we're
            making K-12 and college educational opportunities more affordable for those where a private education is
            just out of reach. The Personalized Education Foundation is a 501 (c)(3) organization, so all donations are tax-deductible.</p>

         </div>
    <p>To help offer tuition assistance opportunities to families in need, we are partnering with FACTS, a third-party organization, to assess financial need and manage the disbursement of funds. For more information about FACTS and their process, please visit their FAQ page. The amount of tuition assistance varies based on financial need and the success of our fundraising efforts. Families can apply for tuition assistance annually. New applications will be accepted again in February 2025. </p>

      <p><strong>Unlock Unlimited Possibilities:</strong> Your gift to the Personalized Education Foundation is a truly unrestricted
            contribution. This means it can be deployed where it's needed most, providing vital support to students and
            families facing challenging circumstances. Many of these families depend on CMASAS to escape the limitations
            of their local public-school systems, and the Personalized Education Foundation Tuition Assistance fund offers them
            relief, enabling their students to thrive in CMASAS' nurturing environment. <br><br>
          
        <strong>Community United: </strong>When you
            contribute to our Tuition Assistance fund, you're not just giving; you're joining a community that believes in the
            power of education to change lives. Your participation sends a powerful message of solidarity and attracts
            further support from external sources. Together, we're creating opportunities for those who might otherwise
            struggle to afford a CMASAS education, shaping the future, one student at a time. </p>

        <p>Inspired by the heroic life and acting in her memory, CMASAS honors Christa McAuliffe by educating the next
            generation of global leaders. CMASAS opened in July 2009 and is the culmination of over 25 years of combined
            experience, knowledge, and perseverance in alternative education of its Co-founder and Executive Director
            Christopher Geis.<br>
          <br>



            Since 2009, CMASAS has grown from its rather humble beginnings into a thriving worldwide organization
            headquartered in the Pacific Northwest. CMASAS operates under Personalized Education Group, Inc., an
            educational management organization. Our knowledgeable, experienced, and passionate team of administrators,
            office staff, and educators foster a sense of community and an atmosphere of harmony where new ideas can
            take root and grow more easily and where innovation is welcomed and applauded. </p>
